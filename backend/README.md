# Find Synonyms Backend Project

## Introduction

This project is the backend service for the Find Synonyms application. It provides APIs for managing products, orders, and user information.

## Synonyms Search Tool

Implement a system that functions as a synonyms search tool with the following features:

- Users can add new words along with their synonyms.
- Users can request synonyms for a word, with lookup working bidirectionally. For example, if "wash" is a synonym for "clean", both words should return each other as synonyms.
- Each word can have multiple synonyms, all of which should be returned upon request.
- Use simple, fast data structures in the backend's memory for storage, with no persistence required.
- The solution is implemented with production-quality code.
- Implement the transitive rule: if "B" is a synonym for "A" and "C" is a synonym for "B", then "C" should also be a synonym for "A".

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- [Vtest](https://jestjs.io/) - A delightful JavaScript testing framework.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - API documentation. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API endpoints.
